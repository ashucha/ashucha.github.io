            My experiences as a servant leader and as a young professional have
            guided my pursuits and attitude toward how I conduct and guide
            myself and others. At every opportunity I get, I try to help someone
            out, be it on something as simple as doing homework or as complex as
            fixing their phone. In addition to this, I make sure to encourage
            them to do the same for others. By spreading the spirit of helping
            others, I hope to develop a community which proactively addresses
            and solves its problems through a collective effort as a united
            community with common goals can tackle any issue, no matter the
            magnitude.

          <div class="col-12 py-3">
            Throughout my high school career, I have consistently sought
            opportunities to further my leadership skills and experience. In
            addition to being a Student Leader as part of Student Leadership
            Johns Creek and a Student Ambassador for the Georgia Secretary of
            State's Office, I am the Co-Founder and Captain of Northview High
            School's Science Bowl Team and Vice President of the Northview
            Programming Club. Each of these experiences has carried with it a
            different set of expectations ranging from managing a team to
            teaching a large group to leading volunteering efforts. From these
            opportunities, I have gained invaluable lessons that have not only
            helped develop me as a leader but also as a young professional, and
            I believe that they will help me in my future pursuits to become an
            AI engineer with a degree in AI from a prestigious tech university.

          <div class="col-12 py-3">
            From my leadership experiences, I have learned some key values of a
            leader that I carry with me. Primarily, I strive to be a leader who
            is not always be the smartest one in the room. I will listen to
            those around me who are more knowledgeable and take the appropriate
            course of action based on those inputs. In a world where one cannot
            be the best at everything, this is an essential value of a leader.

              On March 14th, 2019, I received the email I had been eagerly
              waiting for for weeks. I was excited to be accepted into Student
              Leadership Johns Creek’s Class of 2021. Little did I know how much
              this two-year program would change me both as a community leader
              and as a professional.
            </p>
            <p class="relfection-paragraph">
              Soon, I found myself thrown into leading a group project at The
              Drake House to teach advanced computer skills and concepts to the
              children there, kids who were worrying about their next meal and
              separation from family. Ironically, I learned more from the
              children, about the power of positivity, determination, and
              extending a helping hand, than I taught them about computers and
              digital technology. From this experience, I recognized the impact
              that I could have and desired to use my skills to make a
              difference in my community.
            </p>
            <p class="relfection-paragraph">
              Last summer, while scrolling through my neighborhood’s Nextdoor, I
              learned that many parents in my community were struggling to
              engage their children in fun and educational activities during the
              pandemic. My previous experience at The Drake House pushed me to
              get together with a few friends to teach coding to these kids. Our
              bootcamp, called Code Up!, was a success, drawing hundreds of
              children from across the country. This was when I truly realized
              the potential of SLJC to help me grow as a leader. When I first
              heard that we were doing a portfolio project, I thought I was set.
              With a LinkedIn profile and resume set up, I felt that this would
              be a walk in the park for me. However, as I learned more and more
              about the various aspects of and considerations for a professional
              identity, I realized how much of a challenge this project would
              be.
            </p>
            <p class="relfection-paragraph">
              First off, I was unsure about which specific path within the vast
              field of computer science I would pursue. Split between web
              development and AI, I started researching the career paths as well
              as my interests through the StrengthsQuest survey. When I got my
              results, I realized that AI would be the best path for me.
            </p>
            <p class="relfection-paragraph">
              Next, I needed to figure out what to use for my portfolio site.
              Would I use Weebly as a quick and dirty but extremely primitive
              solution, or would I code it, toiling through the long and arduous
              task of building and deploying but learning about web deployment
              along the way? I chose the road less traveled by and decided to
              code it, a decision I will never regret.
            </p>
            <p class="relfection-paragraph">
              Although it required a great deal more work and effort to achieve
              the same results as using Weebly, coding my site made the
              otherwise long task of making an online portfolio much more fun
              and engaging as I was able to customize various aspects of my site
              like transitions and mouse pointer animations. I also gained a lot
              of invaluable technical knowledge along the way. For example, I
              learned how to add a custom domain to my site for free, get a free
              SSL certificate to make connections to my site more secure, and
              host my site on Google to bolster my portfolio. In addition to
              technical knowledge, I learned much about maintaining an LinkedIn
              profile, like what to list where, how to describe work
              experiences, making an effective headline. I also learned how to
              make a business card, sell myself to recruiters by choosing the
              right words to describe me, and connect with other people to
              expand my network of contacts.
            </p>
            <p class="relfection-paragraph">
              As I neared the completion of my project, I realized how much I
              had changed since I started working on it. From a simple, nearly
              empty LinkedIn page, I now have a full-fledged profile as well as
              a portfolio website. My choice of career has also narrowed down to
              an AI engineer and I have taken steps to brand myself as such. I
              am not only grateful for the opportunities that this portfolio
              project has afforded me, but also how SLJC has changed me as a
              person. From a high schooler uncertain about his future, I have
              changed into a student leader planning for his career, something
              that I have realized sets me apart from my peers, and a
              transformation that would only have been possible as part of
              SLJC’s class of 2021.
